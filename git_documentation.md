Fix: don't modify the original Path instance with __truediv__(). | 1 |
| Fix original Path instance modification from __truediv__

Path class's __truediv__ should make a true copy, and not
modify the original instance of Path. Creating a new instance
with `path=self.segments` sets the new instance's path as a
pointer to the old instance's segments.

Also, add test assertion that the original instance is not
modified with __truediv__ when isabsolute is True.

>>> furl.furl("http://example.com") / furl.Path("example") | 1 |
| Make __truediv__ return new instance | 1 |
| Line wrap header. | 1 |
| Set an explicit API logo height to prevent a flash of unstyled content (FOUC). | 1 |
| Link to api.svg in the repo. | 1 |
| Publish both a source distribution and a Wheel to PyPi. | 1 |
| Explicitly include tests/ in the source distribution. This shouldn't be required, as per https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/sourcedist.html#specifying-the-files-to-distribute, but v1.2.1's sdist release strangely and uniquely didn't include tests/. | 1 |
| Add the default ports for more common protocols, as suggested by the common protocols included in urllib/parse.py. | 1 |
| Ignore lambda expression usage in IceCream import fallback. | 1 |
| Remove support for Python 2.6, which reached EOL on 2013-10-29. | 1 |
| Furl v1.2.1. | 1 |
| Set an explicit logo height to prevent flash of unstyled content (FOUC). | 1 |
| Add IceCream import with graceful fallback. | 1 |
| Join URLs without an authority (e.g. 'foo:blah') consistently with urllib.parse.urljoin(). Big thanks to Ben Wilber for reporting. | 1 |
| Switch to relative path for readme logo. | 1 |
| Tweak furl.asdict() readme example. | 1 |

| Support appending path segments to both furl objects and Path objects via the division operator (__truediv__()). | 1 |
| Percent-encode all non-unreserved characters in Query key=value pairs, including valid query characters (e.g. '=', '?', etc). Old behavior: "?url=http://foo.com/". New behavior: "?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffoo.com%2F". | 1 |

| Rename quote_func to the more standard quote_fn. | 1 |

| Support all schemes without a netloc/authority without an explicit whitelist of such. Add strip_scheme() function and expose get_scheme() and set_scheme() publicly. | 1 |
| Drop support for Python 3.3. Python 3.3 reached EOL on 2017-09-29, and in turn both wheels and setuptools dropped support for it. As a result, Python 3.3 is no longer testable on https://travis-ci.org/. See https://travis-ci.org/gruns/furl/jobs/380056956: "wheel requires Python '>=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*' but the running Python is 3.3.6". | 1 |

| setup.py: Don't pin exact version of six

Since furl is a library, having furl pin exact versions of dependencies means you are limiting the usability of furl when you pin an exact version of `six`. Six months down the road, someone may have an app and want to use `six>=1.9.0` or even `six==1.8.2` (Or a library the app uses may require this) and then they'll be stuck. Best to keep dependencies as loose as possible. If furl works with `six==1.6.0` for example then change it to require `six>=1.6` and more people will be able to use furl. | 1 |
